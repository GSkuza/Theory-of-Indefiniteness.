# Theory-of-Indefiniteness.
The Generalized Theory of Mathematical Undefiniteness (GTMØ) is an innovative mathematical and philosophical framework that extends classical concepts of existence, non-existence, and infinity. GTMØ introduces indefiniteness (Ø) as a fourth, irreducible category of reality—beyond what is classically definable in logic and mathematics.
