# GTMØ: Generalized Theory of Mathematical Indefiniteness

The Generalized Theory of Mathematical Indefiniteness (GTMØ) is an innovative mathematical-epistemic system that extends classical logical and mathematical frameworks by introducing the fundamental category of indefiniteness (Ø).

## Introduction

GTMØ explores the boundaries of mathematical, logical, and epistemic cognition, taking into account phenomena that are not fully definable or reducible to classical categories (0, 1, ∞). Indefiniteness (Ø) plays a central role, representing states where traditional mathematical structures collapse or become inapplicable.

## Key Concepts

### Indefiniteness (Ø)

Ø represents a distinct mathematical category that cannot be reduced to classical numerical or logical sets:

* **Translogical Isolation:** No classical function leads to Ø.
* **Epistemic Singularity:** No cognitive system can fully capture Ø.
* **Topological Boundary:** Ø appears as a boundary within cognitive space.
* **Meta-Closure:** Ø triggers self-assessment and system adaptation processes.

### Knowledge Particles (Ψᴷ) and Knowledge Shadows (Ψʰ)

* **Knowledge Particles (Ψᴷ)** – fragments characterized by high determinacy and stability, easily classifiable and interpretable.
* **Knowledge Shadows (Ψʰ)** – fragments that are unclear, unstable, partially indefinite, and requiring further interpretation.

### Cognitive Trajectories φ(t)

Cognitive trajectories represent the dynamics of cognitive state changes over time, with Ø serving as a critical boundary point:

* **φ(t)** – models the progression and transformations of cognitive processes.
* **φ′(t)** – denotes cognitive acceleration, measuring the speed of transitions between states.

### Cognitive Entropy E(x)

Cognitive entropy measures the level of order or disorder within knowledge:

* Lower entropy corresponds to stable, well-defined states (Ψᴷ).
* Higher entropy indicates less defined states (Ψʰ).

## GTMØ Axioms

1. **Ontological Indefiniteness:** Ø ∉ {0, 1, ∞}
2. **Translogical Isolation:** No classical function leads to Ø.
3. **Epistemic Singularity:** Ø is not fully knowable.
4. **Non-representability:** Ø cannot be represented conventionally.
5. **Topological Boundary:** Ø forms a cognitive boundary.
6. **Heuristic Extremum:** Ø is the minimal entropy point.
7. **Meta-Closure:** Ø triggers system self-assessment.

## Operational Theorems of GTMØ

* **Dynamic Thresholds:** Classification thresholds for Ψᴷ and Ψʰ adaptively depend on the global distribution of knowledge quality.
* **Meta-feedback Loop:** Iteratively optimizes classification, dynamically adapting to changes.
* **Entropy Minimization:** GTMØ aims to minimize global entropy, promoting cognitive stability.
* **Emergence Handling (Ψᴺ):** Detecting emergent knowledge particles triggers system evolution processes.

## Applications

GTMØ finds applications across various fields:

* Solving problems involving undefined or paradoxical phenomena.
* Modeling cognitive and evolutionary processes in artificial intelligence.
* Analyzing epistemic boundaries within mathematical and logical sciences.

## Summary

The Generalized Theory of Mathematical Indefiniteness (GTMØ), developed by **Grzegorz Skuza**, allows exploration of epistemic and mathematical boundary phenomena. It introduces new logical and mathematical categories, providing advanced tools for studying cognitive dynamics and adaptive processes beyond classical logical systems.
